This is a repo used to practise the use of genetic algorithm with neural networks and visualizing a game using Julia. 

The code is by far not optimized but it works. I won't update the code because I want to use it as a starting point in my quest to learn more about AI and it's techniques. For me it was more important to have working code then perfect code. 

The code can be run by following the following steps:

First install Julia if itâ€™s not on the machine. 

Then go to the path where you stored this repo and open a terminal. Copy and paste the following commands.

'julia --project -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"'

Then the following command can be used to run the main script:

'julia --project main.jl'

The code is tested with Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (using WSL2). Julia 1.6.3 was used to test the code.
